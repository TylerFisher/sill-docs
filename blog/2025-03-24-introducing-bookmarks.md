Now you can save important links from your network to access later. Also, you can now access your daily digest archives.

## Bookmarks

Bookmarks are easy to use. Every link in Sill has a bookmark icon in its toolbar. Click this icon to save the link to your bookmarks. You can access your bookmarks through the navigation menu or by visiting [sill.social/bookmarks](https://sill.social/bookmarks).

When you bookmark a link in Sill, Sill will continue to watch for new posts sharing that link, even beyond the standard 24-hour window. This makes bookmarks a great way to track conversation about a particular link over time. For example, I'll be using bookmarks to track shares to [sill.social](https://sill.social), so I can see what my network is saying about Sill.

On the bookmarks page, bookmarks are listed in reverse chronological order based on the time that you bookmarked the link. You can also search your bookmarks. Searches operate on the URL of the link, as well as the link text and link description.

Bookmarks are currently free, along with the rest of Sill. When paid plans for Sill launch, bookmarks will be a paid feature. I am currently targeting a summer launch for subscriptions.

## Daily Digest archives

You can now view past editions of your Daily Digest by going to [sill.social/digest/archive](https://sill.social/digest/archive). Click on the date you want to view to go to the web version of your digest, complete with the archived link and post data. You can also reach your archive by clicking "Daily Digest" in the navigation.

Don't have a Daily Digest? Head to [sill.social/digest/settings](https://sill.social/digest/settings) to set yours up. You can receive a daily email or RSS item at the time of your choosing with the top 10 links from your social networks.

## Help spread the word

I plan to launch subscriptions this summer. Until then, I'm focusing on platform stability and adding better information management tools to help you get the most out of your social networks.

I'm also looking to grow Sill's user base. If you enjoy using Sill, please help spread the word on Bluesky and Mastodon. Word of mouth is the best way for Sill to grow.
