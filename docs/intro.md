# What is Sill?

Sill finds the most popular links in your Bluesky and Mastodon feeds to give you a clear picture of whatâ€™s happening. It does this by watching your timelines for links that people post, and then aggregates them by the number of people who shared each link.

You can sign up for Sill at [sill.social](https://sill.social). Sill is also available as an [open source application](https://github.com/TylerFisher/sill). Docs for self-hosting will come to this website soon.

In this documentation, you can read about [how to create an account](./1-setting-up-sill/signing-up-for-sill.mdx), [how to use your account](./2-using-sill/links.mdx), and [extra features available with Sill+](/category/sill).
