# Bookmarks

*Note: While Sill is still in beta, all Sill+ features are free.*

Bookmarks allow you to save important links from your network to access later. When you bookmark a link, Sill will continue to track new posts sharing that link, even beyond the standard 24-hour window.

## Adding Bookmarks

Every link in Sill has a bookmark icon in its toolbar. Click this icon to save the link to your bookmarks.

<div style={{
  maxWidth: "500px",
  margin: "0 auto"
}}>
<img src={require('./assets/bookmarks-toolbar.png').default} style={{
  width: "100%",
  height: "auto"
}} alt="A Sill link card with the bookmarks icon on the toolbar" />
</div>

## Accessing Your Bookmarks

You can access your bookmarks in two ways:
- Through the navigation menu
- By visiting [sill.social/bookmarks](https://sill.social/bookmarks)

## Managing Bookmarks

On the bookmarks page, your saved links are listed in reverse chronological order based on when you bookmarked them.

<div style={{
  maxWidth: "500px",
  margin: "0 auto"
}}>
<img src={require('./assets/bookmarks-page.png').default} style={{
  width: "100%",
  height: "auto"
}} alt="The bookmarks page showing saved links" />
</div>

### Searching Bookmarks

You can search your bookmarks using the search bar at the top of the bookmarks page. Searches operate on:
- The URL of the link
- The link title
- The link description

### Removing Bookmarks

To remove a bookmark, simply click the bookmark icon again on any link card. The icon will toggle between filled (bookmarked) and unfilled (not bookmarked) states.

## Use Cases for Bookmarks

Bookmarks are particularly useful for:
- Saving articles you want to read later
- Tracking ongoing conversations about specific links
- Creating a personal collection of valuable resources
- Monitoring how your own content is being shared across networks

For example, you might bookmark links to your own blog posts or website to track shares and discussions about your content over time.
