# Manage your account

By navigating to the [account page](https://sill.social/settings), you can take a few actions with your account.

## Change your email address

If you need to change your email address, follow these steps from the account page:

1. Click the "Change your email" button. 
2. On the next screen, enter the new email address you would like Sill to use as your login and click "Send confirmation".
3. Once you submit this new email address, Sill will send a verification email to the new address. Copy and paste the code from the email and paste it in the field in Sill and click "Verify."

NOTE: After you change your email, Sill will use this new email address as your login identifier, and all Sill emails will go to the new email.

## Change your password

If you need to change your password, follow these steps from the account page:

1. Click the "Change your password" button.
2. Enter your current password, your new password, and your new password a second time. Click "Change password."

## Delete your account

If you would like to delete your account, simply click the "Delete your account" button. Then, on the confirmation prompt, click "Yes, delete my account".

NOTE: Deleting your account is an irreversible action. If you want to use Sill again, you will need to register for a new account.
